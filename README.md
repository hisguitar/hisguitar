# EXPERIENCE IN 3D MODELING
## Bedroom
This is a project I worked on during my 2nd year at Bangkok University. The project was to create any room that I wanted, so I chose to sculpt my bedroom. I meticulously measured almost everything in it. It was quite challenging, but also very fun! üòÑ

## P90 Gun
The project was to sculpt any weapon, so I chose something I wasn't very familiar with: a gun. I thought it might be a good opportunity to learn about design, as I typically play a lot of RPG games and rarely touch FPS games.

## [War Spaceship](https://hisguitar.itch.io/warspaceship)
The project was to sculpt any vehicle + animation of it, So I chose the most dynamic thing to animate, a war spaceship, because I thought the shooting and movement would be more dynamic than the other vehicles.
You can find [more details about this project on Itch.io](https://hisguitar.itch.io/warspaceship), and you can support me there as well.
