# EXPERIENCE IN GRAPHIC DESIGNER & PHOTO EDITOR
## Game Cover: Quartz Core
This game cover was both photographed and edited by me as part of a project I developed during my 3-month internship at Wolveden Production, where I worked as a Unity Developer. The design reflects the game's core concept and visual identity.

![Quartz Core Cover](Showcase%20of%20works/QuartzCore_Cover.png)

## Logo & Car Wrap Design: Slide-Car
This is a logo and custom car wrap pattern I designed while working as a graphic designer. The project required combining branding elements with real-world application on a vehicle, blending visual appeal with functionality.

## Benz E63 AMG – Comic Style Illustration
As part of my graphic design work, I transformed a photo of a Benz E63 AMG into a comic-style illustration. This piece showcases my ability to merge realistic imagery with stylized digital effects for creative visual storytelling.

# EXPERIENCE IN 3D MODELING
## Bedroom
This is a project I worked on during my 2nd year at Bangkok University. The project was to create any room that I wanted, so I chose to sculpt my bedroom. I meticulously measured almost everything in it. It was quite challenging, but also very fun! 😄

![Bed Room Image 1](Showcase%20of%20works/BedRoom_1.jpg)
![Bed Room Image 2](Showcase%20of%20works/BedRoom_2.jpg)
![Bed Room Image 3](Showcase%20of%20works/BedRoom_3.jpg)

## P90 Gun
The project was to sculpt any weapon, so I chose something I wasn't very familiar with: a gun. I thought it might be a good opportunity to learn about design, as I typically play a lot of RPG games and rarely touch FPS games.

## [War Spaceship](https://hisguitar.itch.io/warspaceship)
The project was to sculpt any vehicle + animation of it, So I chose the most dynamic thing to animate, a war spaceship, because I thought the shooting and movement would be more dynamic than the other vehicles.
You can find [more details about this project on Itch.io](https://hisguitar.itch.io/warspaceship), and you can support me there as well.
