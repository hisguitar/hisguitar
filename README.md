# EXPERIENCE IN 3D MODELING
### Bed Room
This is a project I worked on during my 2nd year at Bangkok University. The project was to create any room that I wanted, so I chose to sculpt my bedroom. I meticulously measured almost everything in it. It was quite challenging, but also very fun! üòÑ

### P90 Gun
The project was to sculpt any weapon, so I chose something I wasn't very familiar with: a gun. I thought it might be a good opportunity to learn about design, as I typically play a lot of RPG games and rarely touch FPS games.
